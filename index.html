                    <h5>ABM Architects</h5>
                      <p>Architecture, to Alfaz Miller, has always represented a satisfying amalgamation of his various interests: he loved to sketch; was interested in science and math. 
                         Alfaz Miller established ABM Architects soon after achieving his Bachelor of Architecture from JJ School of Art in 1972.The firm has grown from a 70-square-foot 
                         one-man-office to a 7,000-square-foot building at the center of Mumbai. Miller's proficient design skills, grounded ethics, and sharp business acumen, continue to
                         define his self-sufficient firm - which possesses all capabilities required for transforming ideas on paper, into brick-and-mortar realities.Miller's success story was triggered 
                         by the restoration of the interior architecture of ANZ Grindlay's Fort office in Mumbai (1989), overcoming the challenges posed by a design intervention in a functional workspace. 
                         The project cemented ABM Architects reputation for creating solution-driven design programs, and prioritizing quality of work, timelessness. Above everything, the project
                         laid a foundation for a long-lasting client relationship, which ABM prides itself on maintainin As Alfaz enters his elegant and eclectic workplace in Studio Millernium, Mumbai, 
                         it hums with high-octane energy, perfectly in keeping with his approach to every project. One of the firm's many specialties is residential architecture, and his office mirrors 
                         this expertise, with its division into intimate seating and work areas all designed for an open exchange of ideas, and Alfaz's collection of art and vintage cars.
                         Under Miller's guidance, ABM Architects has successfully delivered several projects across all scales and buildings typologies: banks, office buildings, airport lounges,
                         residential complexes and villas, each responding to the unique programmatic constraints and the client's exact needs.</p>

                      <p>Architecture BRIO engages actively in the creation of contextually appropriate, sustainable design solutions within an increasingly changing world.
                         The work of the studio addresses new ways of understanding the often contradictory interrelations between the city, architecture, landscape, and the 
                         world of interiors. There is a growing need for our built environment to re-establish healthy relationships with the natural world. Similarly there
                         is an urgency to address the never before seen growth in urban and rural areas in India and globally.Within this context, the work searches for a delicate
                         balance between architecture as the act of disappearance, and creating characterful, responsive and experiential environments.</p>
